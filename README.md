OUR FINAL COMMIT IS ON BRANCH "AUGUSTO"
Welcome to UNB DATES
  This is a dating app to be used for matching with other members of the University of New Brunswick Family.
  
  Before installation:
    -this application has so far only been developed for the android operating system, there is no iOS support so far.
    -this application was developed on android studio, and requires that for building, debugging, editing and installation.
    -if you wish to download the apk directly, you can access the latest build in the directory app\build\outputs\apk\debug.
    -this app requires a ~11mb of free space on your device of use.
    -this app uses a real time database hosted by google services called Firebase, as of the moment of this writing it is an unlocked database but future updates will ensure the secure use of user information provided to us in confidentiality.
  
  Sign up:
    -The initial sign up is simple, enter the information in the required fields and hit the submit button at the bottom, remember that your email address will be your only method of authentication for future log ins.
      -note: be careful of not leaving any fields empty or the app may encounter problems handling the empty strings
    -Here you will be led to the Upload profile picture page
      -first press the plus button in the middle of the screen to go to the image picker, after having succesfully picked an image, press the upload button at the bottom of the screen to complete your registration!!
      
  Home Page:
    -This is the main hub of the user experience, where you are presented with information, as well as 4 different buttons.
    -Information displayed include a profile picture, your name, and your bio.
    -Your four buttons will be the chat button, the matches button, the settings button, and the logout button.
    
  The logout button:
    -this is the easiest button to understand, it is the way to go back in to the login screen if you have already logged in, and will allow you to commence a new user session
    
  The matches button:
    -This button will proceed to show you swipe cards of all the users with whom you have been shown compatible
    -You may proceed to swipe right or left on the user if you do or do not desire to match with them respectively. 
    -this is also the menu where you are given the option on the bottom of the screen to chat with all of the people who have matched with you (ie. you both swiped right on eachother)
    
  The settings button:
    -When you click on this button, the option to edit your biography and username will pop up. Just like the registration form, be wary to fill out both forms so that the app doesnt run into problems.
     -after editing your fields, you must hit "CONFIRM" for the changes to take effect
     
  The chat button (or the "chat with your matches button")
    -this button has some work to be done to it, as of right now it encounters problems whenever clicked, a future update will possibly help that.
    
  -Other than that the tour of the app is complete! Enjoy your use of our app and any feedback is welcome and encouraged.
